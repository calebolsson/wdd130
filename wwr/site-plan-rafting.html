    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this page has to do with whitewater rafting. It appears that the page may end up as a commercial site for a place to rent rafts, an online store to purchase rafting materials, or perhaps an informational site about the history and practice of whitewater rafting. I'm not sure yet what it will be. I will update this statement as my purpose becomes more clear.</p>
    <!-- change this -->

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>The audience will undoubtedly be interested in whitewater rafting. We will want to keep in mind that surely, some visitors will have experience with rafting, and others will be new. We want to plan the site in a way that will provide a helpful experience for viewers of all backgrounds.</p>
