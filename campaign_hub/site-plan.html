        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>I am creating this site order to provide a simple way for my players to learn more about the universe they
            are exploring. It will connect the different stories we are telling together by linking timelines,
            locations, and names across all the campaigns I have ran with them.</p> <!-- change this -->


        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>My audience will be the friends who have played in my Dungeons and Dragons campaigns in the past and present.
            They know their own stories and friends, but may not know the other stories or people from the other
            campaigns. This site should reach out to them by being friendly to all the demographics that exist within my
            player base.</p> <!-- change this -->

        <h3>Home page</h3>
        <p>
            The entire idea of this main page is to have a pretty screen with cool pictures and not a lot of words. I
            want to be able to communicate how to use the site using an intuitive interface rather than paragraphs of
            explanation. To hit the word limit (and as a backup in case I just want to cheap out and slap an ugly wall
            of text on my front page) here is a very direct approach to what my front page might say.

            Hello, and welcome to Caleb's Campaign Hub! Here you will be able to explore the worlds and stories that are
            being woven into one great universe. Click on the navigation above to view information sorted by timeline or
            location, as well as access to the Encyclopedia. In the timeline view, you will see an overview of the
            campaigns and how each one has effected the others. For a more specific detailing of the events of each
            campaign, view the campaign's individual page. In the location page you will find a list of planes and their
            connections, as well as which campaigns took place in their settings. For a more detailed explanation of
            those worlds and places, read the Encyclopedia, where many names and nouns will be documented in a manner
            that will allow you to use your browser's page search function to find exactly what you are looking for.

        <h3>Timeline</h3>
        <p>
            Here you will find an overview of each major event that has shaped the universe. Warning! Spoilers ahead for
            all campaigns, there is no safe place on this page. Read ahead if you dare. For more information on
            characters and locations, search the noun in question on the Encyclopedia page. For more context and details
            about the events of the timeline, read the individual campaign pages linked in each timeline entry.

            The Grid: A rapid advancement in VR technology allows the humans on Earth to tap into a new digital world
            that allows them to live out their wildest fantasies. If you wanted to play a challenging or competetive
            game, you could log in with your friends around the globe and play intensive matches that would require
            coordination and teamwork to conquer. If you wanted to engage in social activities or role-play in
            fantastical stories, then you could meet strangers and participate in immersive experiences heretofore
            unseen in any other work of media. Such an inclusive platform quickly became an international phenomena,
            which dramatically changed the global politics and economy. Nations reformed around broader identities,
            scrambling to retain individuality after such a large collision of cultures. Despite such incredible
            intersections, the world was faced with threats more dangerous than ever before, including but not limited
            to a surge in information warfare, digital espionage, and identity theft. Beneath all the tummult, a rag tag
            group of kids decides to crack a forgotten and supposedly unbeatable puzzle that releases a force that none
            of them were prepared to deal with.

            Heroes: Hundreds of years after a continent-shaping apocalypse, a new team of heroes is formed on the city
            nation of Aureum Spiralis. Claudius has gathered this team in the hopes of stopping a mad construct being
            named the Imperitor from gaining posession of a set of powerful artifacts that would allow him to re-shape
            the fabric of reality itself. Can his team beat the Imperitor to the punch, and gather them all first? Join
            them in their global adventure as the journey to far away lands, fight powerful foes, and learn the truth
            behind their quest.

            Adventures: Many thousands of years after earthlings develop the technology to venture beyond the moon, and
            many thousands of lightyears away from the flourishing planets, a system-wide catastrophy is brewing. Only
            just barely caught on the scanners of an outer rim research station, leading authorities of the Simic
            Combine refute the legitimacy of this danger. What could this mysterious anomaly be? And how is it connected
            to a dark truth about the origin of this universe?

        <h3>Encyclopedia</h3>
        <p>
            Here you can search for any term that you might want additional clarification on. Note: there are so many
            entries in this page that it would not be wise to read these alphabetically, but rather topically. Check out
            the other pages on this site first, then come here if you have a specific question about a word. Reach out
            to Caleb if there are words or ideas missing from the Encyclopedia, and he can elaborate on them for you
            (which will likely result in a new entry).

            Theros: A setting created by Wizards of the Coast that takes inspiration from Greek Mythology. The stories
            told by myself include many images, references, locations, and characters owned by Wizards of the Coast. I
            have purchased a personal copy of the Mythic Odysseys of Theros from D&D Beyond which I have used as a
            backdrop to my own stories and characters that are of my own intillectual invention. To learn more about
            WotC products, go to wizardsofthecoast.com and go to dndbeyond.com to learn more about their game, Dungeons
            and Dragons.

            Wireframes
        </h2>
        <p>
            Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

        <h3>Homepage with Instructions</h3>
        <p>
            The home page will primarily instruct the visitor on how to use the site. There will be a nav menu on the
            left, and key links will appear on the right of each page. There will be a header and footer on each page, but they will not all display in the same way. For this reason they won't appear the same on the following wireframes, but they will still be there in their own ways
        </p>
        <img src="images/mainpagewithinstructions.png" alt="home page wireframe">

        <h3>Template Campaign Page</h3>
        <p>
            I am hoping to make the header and footer different for each page so that they are helpful to the user no
            matter which page they are on. On this page they can see the title of the article they are reading, and the
            footer will be the same as the home page (not displayed here)
        </p>
        <img src="images/content_wireframe.png" alt="page 2 wireframe">

        <h3>Encyclopedia Page</h3>
        <p>
            The header here will show what letter of the encyclopedia the user is on, and the footer will allow the user
            to navigate by click to any letter
