                <h2>Setting and Introduction</h2>
                <p>Armies of powerful constructs descend from the northern reaches, can our grassroots heroes beat back
                    the rising tide of metal and magic?<br><br>This story begins on a plane called Earth where the most
                    common governments are tribes and fiefdoms. A knight named Torgrave is hired by a Sir Claudius to
                    gather a band of warriors and fight back against the invaderes. As this quest unfolds, the hidden
                    truths about this familiar world and this suspicious quest are revealed.</p>

                <h2>Archibald (Aarakocra Druid)</h2>
                <p>What is victory without pleasure? An indulgent and unrestrained bird-man from deep within the forests
                    of La'Dafri, Archibald can never be found without his trusty mouse companion Whiskers. When the
                    magical amulet is removed from Whiskers, he is released into his true form: Despereaux the Displacer
                    Beast. Archibald and Despereaux met during the former's coming of age hunting ceremony. When neither
                    could best the other, they joined forces to never again taste defeat.</p>

                <h2>Chong (Half-Elf Bard)</h2>
                <p>The most legendary stories have yet to be told, at least according to this aspiring bard. While he
                    may have many tales to tell, the book on his belt is mostly empty, with pages being filled as each
                    day goes by. Nothing can get past this quick-witted lute player, and he is known by his friends to
                    be as quick to jab an insult as he is to sing praise.</p>

                <p>Family goes before all, and this dragonborn is prepared to back that up by any means necessary. From
                    the honorable tribe of Judah, Haagen is part of a rich heritage whose wealth and glory has been the
                    stuff of legend since it's first dawn. Equally ancient is their feud with the many other tribes who
                    attempt to take the aforementioned wealth and glory for themselves. Despite recently losing his own
                    family, Haagen remains loyal to all things pertaining to his tribe.</p>

                <h2>Nafaryus (Elf Warlock)</h2>
                <p>While technically under a pact with a patron, this warlock has enough schemes and dreams to be a
                    patron unto himself. No rock remains unturned when he sets his sights on a goal, and no magics
                    are forbidden in his mind. Despite a dark and gloomy appearance, Nafaryus is known to throw his
                    quips as fast as his spells. Which is very fast. And they definitely always land. All the time.</p>

                <p>Honor, virtue, and freedom are the lifelong principles of Torgrave the Terrible. By what means they
                    are achieved is another issue altogether. Nevertheless, justice will prevail under his watch. A
                    stalwart defender and trusty leader, you couldn't ask for a better companion in a fight. Also if you
                    do something stupid then he will bonk you with his shield and remind you that you could do better.

                <p>His name totally doesn't translate into tall in three different languages. He definitely is a
                    fearsome warrior, though. Mistaken for a young lad, he was taken from his family while a fullly
                    grown adult and re-raised by a tribe of barbarians who believed him to be an adolescent. He
                    naturally rose through their ranks and became a renown leader. He now seeks to find balance between
                    his rage and his desire for kindness. He also is very tall.</p>

                <h2>Session 1</h2>
                <p>Torgrave gathered a group of adventurous fellows to fight back against the invasion of deadly arcane constructs. While gathering resources, the party came across some invader sympathizers and slaughtered them. They stole their plans and intercepted a supply drop, AND they killed the entourage, stealing the strange vehicle for their own. The vehicle was covered in arcane runes similar to the symbols they found on a smaller hand-cannon device. The party spent some time attempting to decipher the runes, but were unable to at first.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wiki-block" id="s2">
                <h2>Session 2</h2>
                <p>After a few hours of investigation, the party figured out how to use the hand-cannon device they found, as well as how to pilot the newly dubbed "Killdozer". On their way north, they ran in to the 51st warforged battalion "Ravenguard" but soon after their paths diverged once more. In a small town they came to, they met Dhin, a defector from a mysterious Order who had tasked himself with protecting the last egg of the ancient golden dragon Judah. After encounters with Blackfist, some bears, and a cyborg bounty hunter, the party uncovered clues and solved puzzles that led them ever closer to Judah's fabled Dragon's Hoard.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wiki-block" id="s3">
                <h2>Session 3</h2>
                <p>The party entered the cave they had been led to, and quickly encountered a group of Piercers. Through brilliant teamwork they were able to defeat a terrifying Roper without suffering any casualties. Upon further exploration of the cave, it became evident that it used to house a population of dragon-worshipping individuals. The party came across some items left behind by these peoples, and were forced to fight a skeletal minotaur guard. The party explored further, and found the place to hatch the dragon. It was a beautiful moment, and Haagen started bonding with the baby while the others went deeper into the cave. They found an Aboleth, which taunted them while offering the secret truths to finding their hearts desires, should they be willing to sacrifice something in return.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wiki-block" id="s4">
                <h2>Session 4</h2>
                <p>After briefly debating over whether or not to sacrifice Dhin to the aboleth, the party finished looting the cave. Archibald had a druidic vision at a shrine to an ancient dragon slaying warrior, Chong copied down the rest of the draconic art at the dragon hatching shrine, Nafaryus and Torgrave read some books and spoke with their patrons, Visok started having flashbacks to 'Nam his rough barbarian past, and Haagen started raising baby Draco. After leaving the cave and heading north, they dropped off Dhin at a town, but also picked up Kanaan and Ezra, the hunted Runen. When the party got to the northern shore of La'Dafri, they met Lord Raven and held back a large invading force with the help of the Ravenguard. Torgrave's divine smite and Nafaryus' "Hand Cannon"™ killed off a massive titan construct, and the rest of the party teamed up to defeat a clockwork dragon.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wiki-block" id="s5">
                <h2>Session 5</h2>
                <p>The party clashed with Lord Raven before deciding they would venture into the northern lands to impress Sir Claudius. Visok's nightmares began to subside, Haagen nurtured Draco into his youth, Nafaryus studied the tomes from the draconic library, Torgrave meditated with the Runen, and Chong kept his journals up to date. When they arrived on the far shore, they met Ras the Ecstatic who answered their questions about the invasion and some draconic history. The party learned about Mordred the dragon slayer, and suspect Raven to be somehow connected to him. They trained their friend Draco, who was growing very quickly. Ras told them he thinks the invaders are coming from the northern mountains, so the party headed in that direction. They came across an abomination that nearly killed Archibald, but Chong saved the day by dispelling the magics that had put together the amalgamation. Otherworldly magics frightened the party away from the dark tree, and they continued on their journey northward.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wiki-block" id="s6">
                <h2>Session 6</h2>
                <p>After escaping a mysterious memory-erasing creature (that the party named "Slender-vort") they discovered the mountain pass in the north was guarded by an elf named Uragiri. He informed the party that he serves the Imperator, a leader from another plane who mounted the invasion against our world. The party met and fought Smertel, a part-construct monstrosity who commands the warforged invaders. They escaped just as reinforcements arrived to back up the fleeing Smertel. The party decided to drive the Killdozer up the mountain further west from the village, and when they reached the top they caught a glimpse of the armies of the Imperator.</p>
