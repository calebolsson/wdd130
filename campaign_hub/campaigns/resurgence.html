                <h2>Setting and Introduction</h2>
                <p>Armies of powerful constructs descend from the northern reaches, can our grassroots heroes beat back
                    the rising tide of metal and magic?<br><br>This story begins on a plane called Earth where the most
                    common governments are tribes and fiefdoms. A knight named Torgrave is hired by a Sir Claudius to
                    gather a band of warriors and fight back against the invaderes. As this quest unfolds, the hidden
                    truths about this familiar world and this suspicious quest are revealed.</p>

                <h2>Archibald (Aarakocra Druid)</h2>
                <p>What is victory without pleasure? An indulgent and unrestrained bird-man from deep within the forests
                    of La'Dafri, Archibald can never be found without his trusty mouse companion Whiskers. When the
                    magical amulet is removed from Whiskers, he is released into his true form: Despereaux the Displacer
                    Beast. Archibald and Despereaux met during the former's coming of age hunting ceremony. When neither
                    could best the other, they joined forces to never again taste defeat.</p>

                <h2>Chong (Half-Elf Bard)</h2>
                <p>The most legendary stories have yet to be told, at least according to this aspiring bard. While he
                    may have many tales to tell, the book on his belt is mostly empty, with pages being filled as each
                    day goes by. Nothing can get past this quick-witted lute player, and he is known by his friends to
                    be as quick to jab an insult as he is to sing praise.</p>

                <h2>Häagen-Dazs (Dragonborn Sorcerer)</h2>
                <p>Family goes before all, and this dragonborn is prepared to back that up by any means necessary. From
                    the honorable tribe of Judah, Haagen is part of a rich heritage whose wealth and glory has been the
                    stuff of legend since it's first dawn. Equally ancient is their feud with the many other tribes who
                    attempt to take the aforementioned wealth and glory for themselves. Despite recently losing his own
                    family, Haagen remains loyal to all things pertaining to his tribe.</p>

                <h2>Nafaryus (Elf Warlock)</h2>
                <p>While technically under a pact with a patron, this warlock has enough schemes and dreams to be a
                    patron unto himself. No rock remains unturned when he sets his sights on a goal, and no magics
                    are forbidden in his mind. Despite a dark and gloomy appearance, Nafaryus is known to throw his
                    quips as fast as his spells. Which is very fast. And they definitely always land. All the time.</p>

                <h2>Torgrave the Terrible (Dwarf Paladin)</h2>
                <p>Honor, virtue, and freedom are the lifelong principles of Torgrave the Terrible. By what means they
                    are achieved is another issue altogether. Nevertheless, justice will prevail under his watch. A
                    stalwart defender and trusty leader, you couldn't ask for a better companion in a fight. Also if you
                    do something stupid then he will bonk you with his shield and remind you that you could do better.

                <h2>Visok Grand Alto (Gnome Barbarian)</h2>
                <p>His name totally doesn't translate into tall in three different languages. He definitely is a
                    fearsome warrior, though. Mistaken for a young lad, he was taken from his family while a fullly
                    grown adult and re-raised by a tribe of barbarians who believed him to be an adolescent. He
                    naturally rose through their ranks and became a renown leader. He now seeks to find balance between
                    his rage and his desire for kindness. He also is very tall.</p>

                <p>Once a member of a prestigious order of assassins, Dhin now must continuously evade capture from his
                    former employers. He was exiled from the Order after discovering their plans to destroy some of
                    their loot obtained from Dragon War loot stashes, which included an unborn dragon egg. He meets the
                    party, who has compassion on his plight and join him on his journey to find the lost Temple of the
                    ancient gold dragon Judah and perform the hatching ceremony for Judah's last descendant.</p>

                    infamous red-runed dragon-killing sword passed down from the legendary Mordred himself. He currently
                    commands a squadron of warforged under the guidance of Sir Claudius.</p>

                <h2>Naming the Continents</h2>
                <p>Each continent has either an intentional or an ironic origin to its name. La'Dafri is named after a contraction of "Land of the Free", Aureum Spiralis means "Golden Spiral" in latin, and the "Old World" is an ironic play on the historical concept of the north-american "New World".</p>
